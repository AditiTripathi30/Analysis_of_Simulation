# Analysis of Effect of Protein Mutation on Protein-RNA Interactions : An In-Silico Investigation
Performed computational modelling and MD Simulation of Protein-RNA interaction using GROMACS and generated .xvg files for mutated and wild complexes.
Comparison between wildtype and mutated structures using python libraries Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas.
